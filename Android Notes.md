### Jetpack UI Compose

Jetpack compose is android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on android by using declarative approach - you describe what the UI should look like, and compose takes care of the rest. Instead of Modifying the UI elements imperatively (like with XML + `findViewById()`), you simply declare the UI using kotlin code. 

1. Jetpack Compose Basics
- @Composable : An Annotation used on a function that defines UI in a declarative way.
- Recomposition: When state changes, Composables automatically update the UI. 
- Modifier: Used to decorate or add behavior (e.g., padding, size, click listeners)

2. Layouts:
- Column, Row, Box : Used to arrange the UI components. 
- Arragement & Alignment control positioning. 

#### Assignment
Just Go through compose basics and design the app by understanding the Column, Row, Box, Text, Button.

***mutableStateOf()***  is a function used to create a state holder that tracks changes to a variable. When the variable changes, it automatically triggers UI updates in Jetpack Compose.

**Specifically:**
- It is often created using mutableStateOf()
- When you change a mutable state, any composables that read the state will automatically recompose (refresh)

**remember{}** -> keep the state alive across recompositions.

#### ViewModel
ViewModel in android is a calss that is used to store and manage UI releted Data in a life cycle aware way.

***Why is it important ?***
- In android, things like Activity and Fragment can be destroyed and recreated (for Example, when you rotate the phone. )
- Normally, if you store data inside an activity (say, a list of names), it gets lost when the activity is recreated. 
- ViewModel helps by holding the data seperately  so that even if your activity/fragment is recreated, the data survives. 
- View Model is part of Android Jetpack libraries. 
- Combine ViewModel + mutableStateOf() to make jetpack compose apps powerful.
