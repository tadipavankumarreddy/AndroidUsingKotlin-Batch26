### Jetpack UI Compose

Jetpack compose is android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on android by using declarative approach - you describe what the UI should look like, and compose takes care of the rest. Instead of Modifying the UI elements imperatively (like with XML + `findViewById()`), you simply declare the UI using kotlin code. 

1. Jetpack Compose Basics
- @Composable : An Annotation used on a function that defines UI in a declarative way.
- Recomposition: When state changes, Composables automatically update the UI. 
- Modifier: Used to decorate or add behavior (e.g., padding, size, click listeners)

2. Layouts:
- Column, Row, Box : Used to arrange the UI components. 
- Arragement & Alignment control positioning. 

#### Assignment
Just Go through compose basics and design the app by understanding the Column, Row, Box, Text, Button.
